**Database Creation Game_Collection**

This project involved me creating a database of both the physical copies and the games that I have rented on the Playstation subscription pass in the past and put a considerable amount of time playing to call them a game I have encountered, there are still more games to be added and even more games that I have had the pleasure to experience that are not here, but it mainly documents my physical copies that I have and then games that I have on my game system that have been significant to me during my gaming hobby. The first part of the project was as followed, I was to set up and create a database in SQL to document properties about video games. I decided to go with the following rows and keep it simple but easy to identify, the following columns created were name of the game, the genre, the age rating and the type of game which functioned like a tag system associated with what the game factored into rather than creating more rows for now. Here is the following code that I came up with to create the database.

Figure 1- As you can see, the primary key was identified as the game ID that is the uniquely identifiying value for all the characters in that given database, the conditions set up for the defaults were O or default if there was nothing entered into the table there and the names of the columns/rows highlighted within the table, the database has been created and the table inside it has also been created and it is now in use with in the MYSQL server I am using.
